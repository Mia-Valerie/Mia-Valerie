# Welcome to Mia Morgan's Github profile

I have almost compleated my HyperionDev career changer Data Science Bootcamp in partnership with the Department for Education.
I am now looking for an entry level role or internship in Data Science, Machine Learning or Quantum Technology to start in September 2023.
I am also studying a part-time masters in Quantum Technology with the University of Sussex and plan to continue this around a full time role.
Please take the time to look through my HyperionDev_Data_Science_Course repository for some examples of my work.
